# EventsImpactOnHateSpeech

Due to unforeseen circumstances, we could not release the dataset as planned -- however, our study largely relies on publicly available data that can be retrieved from the Internet Archive, Reddit, and GDELT; enabling interested researchers to reproduce it. While we understand this requires additional time, we do encourage and hope others will try to replicate this study and/or reproduce our results with similar or different methodological approaches.
